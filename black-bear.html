      The American black bear (Ursus americanus ), or simply black bear, is a medium-sized bear endemic to North America. 
      It is the continent's smallest and most widely distributed bear species. American black bears are omnivores,
      with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location. They typically live in largely forested areas, 
      but will leave forests in search of food, and are sometimes attracted to human communities due to the immediate 
      availability of food. Despite the name, some subspecies can be brown or even blond in coloration.

    <h2>How to survive an attack:</h2>

    <p>
      If you are attacked by a black bear, DO NOT PLAY DEAD. Try to escape to a secure place such as a car or building. If escape is not possible, try to Ô¨Åght back using any object available. Concentrate your kicks and blows on the bear's face and muzzle.
