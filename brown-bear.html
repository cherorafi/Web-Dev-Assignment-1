      The brown bear (Ursus arctos ) is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America. In North America, 
      the populations of brown bears are called grizzly bears, while the subspecies that inhabits the Kodiak Islands of 
      Alaska is known as the Kodiak bear. It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora,
      rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus ), which is much less variable in size 
      and slightly bigger on average. The brown bear's range includes parts of Russia, Central Asia, the Himalayas, China, 
      Canada, the United States, Hokkaido, Scandinavia, Finland, the Balkans, the Picos de Europa and the Carpathian region 
      (especially Romania), Iran, Anatolia, and the Caucasus. The brown bear is recognized as a national and state animal in 
      several European countries.

    <h2>How to survive an attack:</h2>

    <p>
      If you are attacked by a brown/grizzly bear, leave your pack on and PLAY DEAD. Lay ï¬‚at on your stomach with your 
      hands clasped behind your neck. Spread your legs to make it harder for the bear to turn you over. Remain still until 
      the bear leaves the area.
