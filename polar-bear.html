      The polar bear (Ursus maritimus ) is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, 
      encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is the largest extant bear species, 
      as well as the largest extant land carnivore. A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg (770–1,540 lb), while a sow 
      (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy 
      a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice 
      and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. Although most polar bears are born on land, 
      they spend most of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means "maritime bear" and derives from this fact. 
      Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is
      present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals.

    <h2>How to survive an attack:</h2>

    <p>
      If bear makes physical contact, fight back. If deterrence/lethal efforts have failed and a polar bear attacks (makes physical contact), do not “play dead”. Fight back using any deterrents available, aiming fists or objects at the bear's nose and face.
      However, fighting back may not help much either because they're incredibly powerful predators with sharp everything. That being said, your best line of defensive attack is to go for the eyes and nose. They're the most sensitive areas and two things a polar bear needs to continue the attack.  
      If you survive, you'll be one of the lucky ones! Should you happen to survive a polar bear attack, the silver lining is that you can write an amazing book about it!
